Here are some opinions from our training participants in *CRC'23*:

image::crc-cybersecurity-survey-2023.png[CRC Cybersecurity survey 2023, align="center"]

[quote, 2023 training participant {counter:participant-2023}]
This was one of the best experiences I've had during my time at a university.

[quote, 2023 training participant {counter:participant-2023}]
Overall it was a very interesting course. I am satisfied with it - it taught me more than 2 years of cybersecurity studies :D

[quote, 2023 training participant {counter:participant-2023}]
The course was conducted very high quality compared to other CRC courses. The commitment of the speakers was evident and their interest in the subject made a very positive impression. The course was very interesting and engaging.

[quote, 2023 training participant {counter:participant-2023}]
I am very pleased that I chose this course among many others. The topics as well as the materials presented, are very important in today's business operations, so I was eager to listen to the lectures presented in the course. It also brought me closer to deciding to start looking for a job in this industry.

[quote, 2023 training participant {counter:participant-2023}]
Very valuable time spent with very friendly and qualified staff from ING Hubs Poland. Nicely organized, the presenter interviewed and interacted with participants on streaming quality and questions on cybersecurity topics. A lot of substantive knowledge and topical anecdotes. As a beginner in the subject, it was a great injection of knowledge and perspective on the topic. I would recommend to others and would gladly attend again and continue to gain knowledge.

[quote, 2023 training participant {counter:participant-2023}]
I am very satisfied with the course. I learned a lot about the operation of cybersecurity teams in companies. The presenters were very friendly and encouraged me to explore the world of Cybersecurity further.

[quote, 2023 training participant {counter:participant-2023}]
The course was a very interesting introduction to the world of Cybersecurity. I recommend it to people who are unsure which way they want to go in the IT world. Having classes taught by experienced industry professionals is a very good idea.

[quote, 2023 training participant {counter:participant-2023}]
Very valuable course, interesting labs, and really a lot of useful knowledge. The biggest plus was that the presenters were practitioners. Course without unnecessary clogging. 100% knowledge and inspiration!

[quote, 2023 training participant {counter:participant-2023}]
The course was very enjoyable. Some Saturdays passed very quickly, and some did not. I really liked the case study idea. All the lecturers were very substantive and explained the issues clearly.

[quote, 2023 training participant {counter:participant-2023}]
The course was conducted very well. A lot of information was presented in the lectures. A big plus is also the materials that will certainly be useful in the future to consolidate information. I am very satisfied with the course, and I hope to join ING Hubs Poland someday.

[quote, 2023 training participant {counter:participant-2023}]
I enjoyed spending time learning new things, especially about audits. I'm surprised you provided us with a schedule specifying the specific time for each class. A big thank you for that, and please continue this course because you did an excellent job. I hope to participate in Vol. 2 of this course in the future :)

[quote, 2023 training participant {counter:participant-2023}]
The course was conducted at a high standard in an interesting way. It guides us through the various levels of CyberSec, as well as gives us the opportunity to acquire new and helpful knowledge, mainly theoretical, which gives us the opportunity to get acquainted with various levels of the industry and helps us decide what is most interesting to us and in what direction we would like to develop. Everyone will find something for themselves, whether a newcomer, unfamiliar with the subject, or even an intermediate who wants to expand their knowledge. I recommend and thank you for the opportunity to participate, it was interesting :)

[quote, 2023 training participant {counter:participant-2023}]
It's great that ING Hubs give a possibility to broaden their horizons in an eld of Cybersecurity for students without work experience. I am very happy I could participate in this course and see a little bit of every area. I'm looking forward to other courses conducted by your company! :)

[quote, 2023 training participant {counter:participant-2023}]
I think that the course is something completely transformative for me, as somebody coming from more of a software development background because that is what I did as a hobby and part of learning new technologies, mainly web technologies. I was always interested in technologies related to security. I used Kali Linux in the past to do some basic pentesting at home with an old router. And when attending this course, I was able to learn information that made me realize how broad and interesting the field of security is in IT. The professionalism of the presenters and the depth at which the topics were explained, along with very interesting practical elements, made it so that I believe I want to actively use the skills learned here in my career in the future. To sum up, it was a very positive experience.

[quote, 2023 training participant {counter:participant-2023}]
I learned a lot of new things during the course. I am glad I had the opportunity to learn about the world of Cybersecurity. The exercises were conducted in a very accessible form and in an extremely interesting way.

[quote, 2023 training participant {counter:participant-2023}]
I enjoyed the course, I have learned many interesting new things and I am happy that I participated in the course.

[quote, 2023 training participant {counter:participant-2023}]
The course, in a single word, was great. A lot of knowledge was passed on in a very friendly way. I learned a lot of useful things that will definitely help me in my development in the field of Cybersecurity, as well as useful in everyday life.

[quote, 2023 training participant {counter:participant-2023}]
You don't need to correct anything in this course.

[quote, 2023 training participant {counter:participant-2023}]
The topics covered were discussed at length by people who clearly have a passion for what they do for a living, and I enjoyed the lectures on conducting attacks and red teaming the most.

[quote, 2023 training participant {counter:participant-2023}]
Very cool course. Hopefully, such courses will be held more often.

[quote, 2023 training participant {counter:participant-2023}]
I really enjoyed the course and the whole format. The instructors were very friendly and professional. I learned a lot of new things that I am eager to use in my future engineering thesis on Cybersecurity.

[quote, 2023 training participant {counter:participant-2023}]

[quote, 2023 training participant {counter:participant-2023}]
Thanks to the whole team for a well conducted classes. Everyone has a lot of knowledge; most importantly, they can convey it understandably. Lots of practical examples from real work, not just theory. In addition, a broad view of the whole CyberSec (VA, Risk Management, Blue Team, Red Team) there is something for everyone :)

[quote, 2023 training participant {counter:participant-2023}]
It's a very cool and valuable course.

[quote, 2023 training participant {counter:participant-2023}]
The course contained a lot of practical and theoretical knowledge provided by practitioners, which allows one to expand knowledge and greater awareness of risks and allows further development! Super course!

Interesting introduction to the topic of cyber security, required theory presented in an understandable way.

[quote, 2022 training participant {counter:participant-2022}]
Everything was correct in my opinion. It was very professional course and I'm very satisfied.

[quote, 2022 training participant {counter:participant-2022}]
In my opinion, all lectures were very interesting, the presenters were well-prepared. I just think that after each lecture should be more practical exercises or something like homework, to consolidate the knowledge of students.

[quote, 2022 training participant {counter:participant-2022}]
It would be great to make this course longer with more practical exercises. But overall it was really great experience.

[quote, 2022 training participant {counter:participant-2022}]
I used the class to systematize my knowledge and learn about the corporate viewpoint and approach. Considering the limited time frame of the class, the topics covered were reasonably developed. I have a very positive opinion on the whole.

[quote, 2022 training participant {counter:participant-2022}]
I think all the points covered in the course are very important, but I would have added an extra week to the course to cover more points in a practical context.

[quote, 2022 training participant {counter:participant-2022}]
I think it's a very much digestible course with many real examples, easy to follow for the IT student.

[quote, 2022 training participant {counter:participant-2022}]
I really enjoyed the practical classes. For that reason, it's a little bit of a pity that there weren't enough of them.

[quote, 2022 training participant {counter:participant-2022}]
Revelation. More meetings than 4.

[quote, 2022 training participant {counter:participant-2022}]
The course was conducted by excellent professionals, in a pleasant atmosphere.

Very cool course, nice to listen to people with actual experience in the field.

[quote, 2022 training participant {counter:participant-2022}]
I think it is always a good idea to spend your time on learning something new. So, in general I'm happy that I could take part in this course and (I hope) get a certificate to showcase my knowledge.

[quote, 2022 training participant {counter:participant-2022}]
I would not change anything about this course.

Even more practice and maybe more advanced stuff! It's been great!

Great course, thanks!

[quote, 2021 training participant {counter:participant-2021}]
It is a pity that the course only lasted two days. There was no time to bite into the topic :)

[quote, 2021 training participant {counter:participant-2021}]
Even more labs would be welcome ;)

[quote, 2021 training participant {counter:participant-2021}]
In my opinion more practical exercises would be better, also homework tasks would be welcome too.

[quote, 2019 training participant {counter:participant-2019}]
It was very helpful to understand security principles.

[quote, 2019 training participant {counter:participant-2019}]
I really liked hearing the entire course finished in just two meetings and all the conversations during the breaks, so I think this is definitely what should stay.

[quote, 2019 training participant {counter:participant-2019}]
Such a course should be at the university as a subject throughout the whole semester. Too many interesting things to explain in 16h.

[quote, 2019 training participant {counter:participant-2019}]
I believe that the course should consist of more classes, as a consequence of which each topic would be discussed in more detail, which would translate into its better understanding and consolidation. The course was very interesting and I am glad to be able to take part in it.

[quote, 2019 training participant {counter:participant-2019}]
Two Saturdays is not enough. Ideally, for example, 6 Saturdays.
