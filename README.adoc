Here are some opinions from our training participants in *CRC'22*:

[quote, 2022 training participant {counter:participant-2022}]
It was a great adventure, comparing to other CRC course that i participated you definitely exceeded my expectations, I will recommend your course to others, thanks :)

[quote, 2022 training participant {counter:participant-2022}]
I liked the opportunity to hear the opinions of many people working in different areas of cyber security.

[quote, 2022 training participant {counter:participant-2022}]
The course was really well run and interesting. Time went by very quickly and it's hard to complain about anything.

[quote, 2022 training participant {counter:participant-2022}]
Very cool course! Awesome that you were able to include hands-on activities!

[quote, 2022 training participant {counter:participant-2022}]
Course was really good and valuable from cyber side. It was performed on the high - level quality.

[quote, 2022 training participant {counter:participant-2022}]
A must have for a newbies who want to jump into the cybersecurity.

[quote, 2022 training participant {counter:participant-2022}]
Interesting introduction to the topic of cyber security, required theory presented in an understandable way.

[quote, 2022 training participant {counter:participant-2022}]
Everything was correct in my opinion. It was very professional course and I'm very satisfied.

[quote, 2022 training participant {counter:participant-2022}]
In my opinion, all lectures were very interesting, the presenters were well-prepared. I just think that after each lecture should be more practical exercises or something like homework, to consolidate the knowledge of students.

[quote, 2022 training participant {counter:participant-2022}]
It would be great to make this course longer with more practical exercises. But overall it was really great experience.

[quote, 2022 training participant {counter:participant-2022}]
I used the class to systematize my knowledge and learn about the corporate viewpoint and approach. Considering the limited time frame of the class, the topics covered were reasonably developed. I have a very positive opinion on the whole.

[quote, 2022 training participant {counter:participant-2022}]
I think all the points covered in the course are very important, but I would have added an extra week to the course to cover more points in a practical context.

[quote, 2022 training participant {counter:participant-2022}]
It was fun - the kindness of lecturers is always appreciated :)

[quote, 2022 training participant {counter:participant-2022}]
I really enjoyed it! I found it really interesting to take a deep dive into the cybersecurity field of work and see how it's done.

[quote, 2022 training participant {counter:participant-2022}]
A very good and valuable course.

[quote, 2022 training participant {counter:participant-2022}]
Maybe more practical lessons - and more lessons in general because the course was very interesting.

[quote, 2022 training participant {counter:participant-2022}]
I think it's a very much digestible course with many real examples, easy to follow for the IT student.

[quote, 2022 training participant {counter:participant-2022}]
I really enjoyed the practical classes. For that reason, it's a little bit of a pity that there weren't enough of them.

[quote, 2022 training participant {counter:participant-2022}]
Revelation. More meetings than 4.

[quote, 2022 training participant {counter:participant-2022}]
The course was conducted by excellent professionals, in a pleasant atmosphere.

[quote, 2022 training participant {counter:participant-2022}]
I learned a lot of new interesting facts and things about cyber security, very interesting and developing course.

[quote, 2022 training participant {counter:participant-2022}]
I learned a lot of cool new information both internally and refreshed the basics, the course was really very enjoyable.

[quote, 2022 training participant {counter:participant-2022}]
Very cool course, nice to listen to people with actual experience in the field.

[quote, 2022 training participant {counter:participant-2022}]
I think it is always a good idea to spend your time on learning something new. So, in general I'm happy that I could take part in this course and (I hope) get a certificate to showcase my knowledge.

[quote, 2022 training participant {counter:participant-2022}]
I would not change anything about this course.

[quote, 2022 training participant {counter:participant-2022}]
A must have for a newbies who want to jump into the cybersecurity.

[quote, 2022 training participant {counter:participant-2022}]
Nice course, opportunity to gain practical knowledge from people working in cyber security.

[quote, 2022 training participant {counter:participant-2022}]
Overall I really enjoyed the course. If possible, even more topics could be covered in the future.

[quote, 2022 training participant {counter:participant-2022}]
Even more practice and maybe more advanced stuff! It's been great!

Great course, thanks!

[quote, 2021 training participant {counter:participant-2021}]
It is a pity that the course only lasted two days. There was no time to bite into the topic :)

[quote, 2021 training participant {counter:participant-2021}]
Even more labs would be welcome ;)

[quote, 2019 training participant {counter:participant-2019}]
It was very helpful to understand security principles.

[quote, 2019 training participant {counter:participant-2019}]
I really liked hearing the entire course finished in just two meetings and all the conversations during the breaks, so I think this is definitely what should stay.

[quote, 2019 training participant {counter:participant-2019}]
Such a course should be at the university as a subject throughout the whole semester. Too many interesting things to explain in 16h.

[quote, 2019 training participant {counter:participant-2019}]
I believe that the course should consist of more classes, as a consequence of which each topic would be discussed in more detail, which would translate into its better understanding and consolidation. The course was very interesting and I am glad to be able to take part in it.

[quote, 2019 training participant {counter:participant-2019}]
Two Saturdays is not enough. Ideally, for example, 6 Saturdays.
